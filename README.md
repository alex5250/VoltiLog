# What it is 
VoltLogV2
This is an small device that allow record an voltage and current in two modes. The simplest mode is when the device is connected to PC and it sends data throught UART over USB. The second mode is when device is connected to power supply and just records data in internal memory. The all software and hardware is open sources and avabile there.
